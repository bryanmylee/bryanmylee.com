				<strong>Wave</strong> is a simple pomodoro timer to help you stay focused while working. It alternates
				between a 25 minute focus mode and a 5 minute break mode while displaying beautiful animations.
				Keep your timer in sync with multiple devices and stay on top of your timers with alert notifications!
			</p>
			<p>
				Wave for iOS and Android is built with React Native and Reanimated for its powerful and
				performant animation capabilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the backend, Wave uses Firebase Firestore for its data storage and synchronization
				features. A Google Cloud Function is triggered whenever a user starts or stops a timer. It
				schedules a task with Google Cloud Tasks to send a push notification with Firebase Cloud
				Messaging whenever the timer is completed.
