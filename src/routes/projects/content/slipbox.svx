Slipbox is a cross-platform organizing tool for the modern short-form video-focused Internet user. It was a venture to build a platform that saves videos seamlessly, searches videos quickly, and reminds users of their saved videos effectively.

While developing the platform, it quickly became clear that the feature was not sufficiently viable as a business and was ultimately put on pause.
